// 1. Verbal questions
/* 
1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
Parameters are the variables declared when creating the function. Arguments are the variables you pass into the function when calling it.
2. Within a function, what is the difference between return and console.log?
Return allows a function to output a value, console.log just prints to the console. i.e. Return statements return something tangible that can be used, console.log just prints something.
3. What are the implications of the ability of a function to return a value? 
This allows the programmer to more concisely get desired values. For instance, if a function was created to get the min number of an array, the return function would allow the programmer to use that number more easily.
